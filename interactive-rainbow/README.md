# Interactive Rainbow Exercise

## Description

Create an HTML document that consists of 7 empty divs. Render each of these divs stacked on top of each other (as they appear in the example image), however, each of your divs will start off as having a white background.

When the user clicks a div the background color of the div must change to a color of the rainbow, and remain that color. The user can then click each of the remaining divs to complete the rainbow effect.
