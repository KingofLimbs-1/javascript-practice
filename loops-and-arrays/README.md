# Loops and Arrays Challenge 

## Description

The challenge requires you to work with **loops and arrays**. You start by creating an array of 10 task items and using a "for" loop to display each item. Then, you modify the loop to calculate the sum of all the items up to 10. Next, you create a loop that generates the 15 times table based on the length of the tasks array. After that, you create an array called timesTable to store the values of the 15 times table. You then loop through this array and print each value. Next, you use the .reduce() method to calculate the average of the timesTable array. As a bonus activity, you repeat the average calculation without using .reduce(). Finally, you use a "for of" loop to iterate through the values of the tasks array and print the output. Additionally, you try to replicate this using a "for in" loop and explain why it displays what it does.
